                            I worked with Eric at Harlo Interactive for almost 2 years. In that time, I've been repeatedly impressed by his dedication and willingness to expand his skill set into new regions. Never underestimate this man, he has pulled out some miraculous code for me that should not have been possible, but Eric always finds a way to make it happen! Eric understands and respects the user experience, visual design, and technical feasibility of each project. He's been creative, hard working and reliable. Eric likes to do things the right way. Heâ€™s smart. He gets things done, ALWAYS. Heâ€™s an ace.

                            Eric is a consistent and crazy good developer. I was always pleasantly surprised when I would check in to see if he need any design assets only to find out he already built the page and added improved interactivity on top of that. Eric stays on top of industry trends and offers up high level thinking to improve our processes. Recommended!

                            If there were two words that best describe Mr. Hussmann, they'd be Fast and Easy. He's the kind of dev that intuitively fills your mental gaps with seemingly common sense solutions that are anything but common. His code is an operating room of cleanliness and his bedside manner puts the most neurotic at ease. He does this all while comfortably exploring new web experiences, keeping his tools sharp, and contributing critical thinking that challenges your assumptions. He's wildly talented. He's honest. He's my go-to for client projects.

                <h2>Member Firm Website Program</h2>
                <p>M Financial has over 100 financial advisor Member Firms, and nearly all of them had very outdated websites in need of modernization. The trick was to find some way to create fully branded and unique websites for each firm at a fraction of the cost they would pay on the open market.</p> 
                <p>My solution was to create a multi-concept Wordpress theme that provides option controls for nearly every aspect of the design. This enables us to quickly and easily adapt each website to the firmâ€™s unique branding and vision at very low cost and quick turnaround. We manage all the websites in a Wordpress Multisite instance which allows us to keep all of them up-to-date and secure. Custom plugins I have developed allow the firms to leverage a compliance-approved content library, and streamline their requests for support and compliance reviews.</p> 
                <p>Finally, all of this is cloud-hosted on DigitalOcean, using a network of VPS servers that I stood up and configured, highly available with 99% uptime.</p>

                <h2>Parkzilla</h2>
                <p>Founder Tim Ashman came to <a href="https://www.harlointeractive.com/" target="_blank">Harlo</a> with unique idea to create an app that would allow users to offer their driveway or parking space for rent. The app would have iOS and Android versions, as well as a web-based profile management tool.</p>
                <p>In order to accommodate all three platforms, I decided to create a cloud-based API using Parse.comâ€™s SaaS. I used Parse's javascript platform (based on Backbone.js) to build a booking engine and Stripe-integrated marketplace, with API endpoints and corresponding documentation. I worked closely with the mobile app developers to tailor the API to their needs.</p>
                <p>I then built out the web application using the Laravel PHP framework that allows users to register, connect with Stripe, and set up their parking spaces for rent with custom pricing schedules.</p>

                <h2>Elemental CMS</h2>
                <p>I built this platform in-house for <a href="https://www.harlointeractive.com/" target="_blank">Harlo</a>. We needed a streamlined way to create custom CMS solutions for clients while also having a ready-made solution to shorten development timelines. Elemental is the best of both worlds. </p>
                <p>Elemental leverages many of Laravel 5's modern PHP features, including namespaces, interfaces, service provider and facade patterns, and the Eloquent ORM. I also developed a command line interface using Laravel's Artisan Console tool. I designed this architecture to make it easy for my development team to install Elemental as a Composer package and get up and running. All of the heavy lifting is abstracted away and developers have only to create some basic array structures to define their CMS components. They can then generate the CMS user interface with a few simple commands in the CLI.</p>
                <p>Elemental also exposes a REST API to interact with the Angular front-end services, as well as any other third-party integrations as needed. Elemental's front-end UI wraps the Semantic UI library in custom Angular directives.</p>
                <p>Finally, I wrote clear and concise documentation to help onboard new team members quickly.</p>

                <p>M Financial approached <a href="https://vogey.com/" target="_blank">Vogey</a> to help them select and implement an enterprise ticketing system that would provide the flexibility to meet the complex business needs of several different internal departments.</p>
                <p>After an in-depth discovery phase and tools assessment, Zendesk was selected and we began implementation. M now utilizes Zendesk's flexibility and features to the fullest extent, providing tech support to it's Member Firms, internal service desk ticketing, automated communication and marketing compliance workflows, and as an advisor reporting platform that meets FINRA books and records requirements.</p>
                <p>My role was to help discover each department's unique business needs and then implement best practice workflows using Zendesk's triggers, automations, views and ticket forms. I developed custom Zendesk apps that help the compliance team approve and capture marketing material updates and streamline advisor reporting. Using Zendesk's API, I created a risk-based algorithm to sift through large volumes of financial reporting tickets and flag a percentage for review. I partnered closedly with M's IT team to implement single sign-on, sync user and organization data, and bulk export Zendesk ticket data into third-party tools.</p>
                <p>Finally, I helped deliver value on the platform to M's upper management by building custom <a href="https://www.gooddata.com/" target="_blank">GoodData</a> reports around their specific KPIs and metrics.</p>

                <p>The largest cannabis-infused food and beverage co-packer on the West Coast, Gesundheit Foods is growing quickly from their Portland headquarters and building out additional facilities in Oakland, LA and Vancouver, B.C. Their rapid growth had left them without a good integrated solution for the administration of their inventory, shipping, R&D and supply chain processes.</p>
                <p>After an intensive discovery phase to learn about their business workflows and pain points, I researched dozens of ERP platforms, from open source to mid-market and enterprise solutions like SAP and NetSuite.</p>
                <p>Ultimately I settled on a Sage X3 implementation that includes various canna-business modules developed by <a href="http://nextecgroup.com/" target="_blank">NexTec Group.</a> I worked closely with the NexTec team to put together a proposal that would meet Gesundheit Food's highly specific needs.</p>
                <p>On the technical side, I helped put together a hosting solution on AWS for the Sage X3 cloud-based platform. I am currently working to integrate Sage X3's API with the state-required cannabis regulation platform <a href="https://www.metrc.com/" target="_blank">Metrc</a>, which will eliminate hours of manual data entry.</p>

                <h2>Abuelita Is Unimpressed</h2>
                <p>This site was created to coordinate with La Tortilla Factory's first-ever digital ad campaign to reach organic-minded shoppers on a national scale.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.harlointeractive.com/case-study/la-tortilla-factory-abuelita" target="_blank">Harlo</a> was contracted to concept, produce, and distribute the campaign and they turned to me to develop the website.</p>
                <p>The site is fully responsive, and helps showcase a half dozen humerous video spots. I also created a custom javascript library to handle the meme generator portion of the site. The user-generated memes drove social network sharing of the campaign by entering participants in a sweepstakes.</p>

                <h2>Fetzer</h2>
                <p>I was hired to help makes some additions and refreshes to Fetzer's corporate website to help them promote their sustainability and environmentally friendly practices.</p>
                <p>Modernizing and adding responsiveness to the legacy codebase was the most challenging part of this project.</p>
